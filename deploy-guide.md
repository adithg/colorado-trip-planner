## 🔧 Quick GitHub Deployment Script

I've created a script to make GitHub deployment super easy:

```bash
# Make sure you're in your Colorado Trip folder, then run:
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. Initialize git repository
2. Add all files
3. Create initial commit
4. Push to GitHub
5. Give you the live URL

## 📝 After Deployment

Once your site is live, you can:
- **Update anytime**: Just push changes to GitHub
- **Add custom domain**: Point your domain to the hosting service
- **Monitor usage**: Check analytics in hosting dashboard
- **Share**: Send the URL to family/friends for trip collaboration
